Real-time, Multi-Camera Video Stream Analysis 

Estimate traffic density with live feeds from New York City Department of Transportation street cameras and identify congested streets in real time.

- Start with a pre-trained vehicle detection model from Roboflow Universe.
- Process stream and visualize results with Supervision.
- Record vehicle counts directly into Google Sheets.
- Expand the system to handle multiple streams simultaneously.

Shoutout to Leo Ueno for creating this cool project!
